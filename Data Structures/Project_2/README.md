# Data Structures : Project 2

## Restaurant Inspection Software

This Java program reads in restaurant inspection results as CSV files and parses each record as a record object. 
The Record objects are then stored into an ArrayList. Methods are provided to search through and sort the data
given user provided keys. 

## Notes on the second version

In this version the sorting method is updated to implement Merge Sort instead of Selection Sort. This results into 
a significantly better perfomance. An in depth analysis and comparison between the two sorted algorithms is provided.
