# Data Structures : Project 1

## Restaurant Inspection Software

This Java program reads in restaurant inspection results as CSV files and parses each record as a record object. 
The Record objects are then stored into an ArrayList. Methods are provided to search through and sort the data
given user provided keys. 

## Notes on the first version

This version of the project is rudimentary. It only makes use of ArrayLists to store the data and selection sort, which takes quadratic time is used to sort the data.
