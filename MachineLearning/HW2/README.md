## Written Exercise

1. Show that the alternative log loss for the label set {-1,1} instead of {0, 0} is equivalent
to the normal logistic regression distance function up to a constant multiplication.
2. Can we use a gradient-based optimization algorithm for finding a solution that
minimizes hinge loss?
3.Show that minimizing the norm of the weight vector of a support vector machine is
equivalent to maximizing the margin.

## Programming Exercise
An image was passed through a mysterious function that modifies the matrix such that
it is impossible to recreate the original image by reverse engineering the steps in the mysterious
function.
